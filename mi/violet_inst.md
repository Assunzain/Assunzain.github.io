**Before start flashingâ€¦**
- Backup all your data to any external source
- Always look for the build if its GAPPS or Vanilla varient
- Only use Retrofit/Super_partition supported recovery
- For Vanilla build flash only the recommended GAPPS zip given in notes and post
- Also for Vanilla build flash gapps zip right after flashing the build , dont flash after booting to rom (ur google apps may crash)
- To get google search in home page , flash nik velvet addon (Only for vanilla build for gapps build its available by default) 
- You can flash other addons to , just make sure you flash it before first boot

**Clean Flash Legacy/Dynamic to Dynamic (Encrypted):**

- Flash provided recovery (Retrofit Supported)
- Wipe only Dalvik/cache , cache and data (Only these 3)
- Flash Rom zip and Format data
- Flash recommended gapps zip and addons if needed (Only for Vanilla Build)
- Reboot System

**Clean Flash Legacy/Dynamic to Dynamic (Decrypted):**

- Follow above steps , just no need to format data
- Remember to flash dfe v5 only for decryption

**Rom Update/Dirty flash:**

- Reboot to recovery
- Flash the downloaded rom
- Flash dfe v5 if decrypted or else ignore if encrypted
- Reboot

**Note:**
- When dirty flashing , flash only Vanilla build over Vanilla and Gapps build over Gapps
- U can also flash without format data if already decrypted with dfe v5 but not recommended
- If getting any issue after dirty flash, Flash clean before reporting.
